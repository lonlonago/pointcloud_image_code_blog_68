Decimal: The range of data is infinite. Integer: It can be expressed clearly within a specific interval. 0~ 1 computer is a binary product: 0, 1 computer represents a decimal number with errors. 

Bool: used for conditional judgment, value range: True, False conversion between underlying data types

Summary: int: integer, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, size comparison, computer is a binary product: 0, 1 computer indicates that a decimal number is subject to error. In Python, all non-zero numbers are True, zero is False. In Python, all non-empty strings are True, empty strings are False. In summary, in Python's basic data types, everything that represents empty is False, and everything that is not empty is True.
