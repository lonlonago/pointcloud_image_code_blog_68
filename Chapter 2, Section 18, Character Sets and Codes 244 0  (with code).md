Scientists used diodes to make a binary '010101 'into decimal to become the Arabic numerals we know. Computers can't just be used for numerical calculations, we also need to read novels and read words. So smart scientists use different methods to replace words, just like the telegram beep beep in the anti-Japanese drama, the Morse password is based on the leverage of the ‘- - . .’ to transmit information.

It only needs 7 zeros and 1s to represent it. 01111111 = > 1 byte = > 8 bits The following are more and more forms: 1.0 1 < = > 10101010 = > binary is converted to decimal < = > 88 How computers store text information 1000000 < = > a
