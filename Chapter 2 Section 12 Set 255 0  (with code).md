Summarize: set collection, set collection is unordered add add remove delete for loop, used for query, the key is to understand the hash, not hash: python set collection for data storage. Need to hash the data, according to the calculated hash value to store data set set set requires that the data stored must be hashable. Variable data types, list, dict, set hashable: immutable data types, int, str, tuple, bool.
