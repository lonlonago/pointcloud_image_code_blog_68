 If you are asked to print a composition, a composition requires seven or eight hundred words, and I ask you to repeat the typing, do you want to copy it? This is very troublesome. If you replace this composition with an alias, it will be very convenient. This alias is a variable, so this is the function of a variable. Look at the picture specifically, don't understand it once, read it twice.

  In summary, a variable is a quantity that can change. Variables are used to distinguish between different data. They can point to a memory space and help us store some data 

Variable naming convention: 1. Must be a number or letter or downline composition. 2. Cannot start with a number, let alone a pure number. 3. Cannot use python keywords 4. Do not use Chinese 5. Do not be too long 6. Be meaningful 7. It is recommended to use downline naming or hump naming 

In summary, your variable name must be understandable. It is comfortable to read.
